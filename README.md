### Hi there 👋

✅ As a highly motivated person who have an advanced English level and experience working in the United States for 4 years, I am looking for new challenges in IT & development areas, to continue growing professionally and personally.

💻 That's why I am currently directing my profile towards web development, having studied HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub. I am also studying React and I have knowledge of web SEO. 

🙋🏻‍♂️ I am very curious, perfectionist, resilient and an Engineer, what is super useful in this environment to face the daily challenges and solve problems. I have creative thinking, ability to learn quickly and flexibility to continuous change. 

🌎 I enjoy a lot travelling & I would love to work remotely. Visit new places, practice trekking, snowboard and swim are my passions, I really love nature life.
