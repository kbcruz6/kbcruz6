### Hi there, welcome to my profile! 👋

### I am Agustin Cruz, a 31 years old Front End Developer & Industrial Engineer

I am a highly motivated human being looking for new challenges in IT & development areas, to continue growing professionally and personally.

💻 That's why I directed my profile towards web development, having studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and GitHub. (I also have knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, web SEO & Blockchain). 

🙋🏻‍♂️ I am very curious, persistent, perfectionist, resilient and an Engineer, what is super useful in this environment to face the daily challenges and solve problems. I have creative thinking, ability to learn quickly and flexibility to continuous change. 

I enjoy a lot travelling & I would love to work remotely. Visit new places, knowing new people, and practice trekking are my passions, I really love nature life.
